# tv-script-generation
Project 3 in the Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree (AI) using a recurrent neural network

The project uses a recurrent neural network architecture with a portion of the Simpson's TV scripts (those occurring only at Moe's Tavern) from 27 seasons that when run on the subset of that database generates a TV script for a scene at Moe's Tavern.
